Join a community of Twitter users in resurrecting your writing.

# 1. Start a Blog

While any service is allowed, we recommend [Medium](https://medium.com/) for those who want to focus on the words, and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) for those who want to add other media.

# 2. Update at Least Once a Week

You don't have to write your magnum opus. 

Write one post once a week and share it.

Stuck? Use [one of these questions](https://worksofgenius.github.io/Icebreaker-Randomizer/) as a prompt.
