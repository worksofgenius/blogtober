<h1>Blogtober</h1><p>
<h2>A blogging initiative for the month of October</h2><p>

<img src="https://worksofgeniusdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/blogtober-1.png"><p>

Join a community of Twitter users in resurrecting your writing.<p> 

Share your posts using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blogtober&src=typed_query">#Blogtober</a>.<p>

<h2>1. Start a Blog</h2><p>

While any service is allowed, we recommend <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> for those who want to focus on the words, and a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> 
for those who want to add other media.<p>

<h2>2. Update at Least Once a Week</h2><p>

You don't have to write your magnum opus.<p>

Write one post once a week and share it.<p>

Stuck? Use <a href="https://worksofgenius.github.io/Icebreaker-Randomizer/">one of these questions</a> as a prompt.<p>
